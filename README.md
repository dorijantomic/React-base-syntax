# React First Assigment Practice - the base syntax
## Tech/framework used
**Built with** *[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)*

# Overview
   In this project I was given a TO DO list ( which you can find below ) to follow and create an app with the current *JSX/REACT* syntax that we were taught through the lovely course made by **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller** and is a part of his course  **ReacT 16 - The Complete guide**
 


### To do :

  - Create two new components: UserInput and UserOutput
  - UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput should hold two paragraphs
  - Output multiple UserOutput components in the App Component
  - Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
  - Add state to the App component and pass the username to the UserOutput component
  - Add a method to manipulate the state ( an event handler)
  - Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
  - Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
  - Add two-way-binding to your input to also display the starting username
  - Add styling of your choice to your components/elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
  -
